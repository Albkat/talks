## Abstract

A thriving community is essential for the success and long-term survival of a programming language. 
Despite the importance of Fortran in science & engineering, and continuous developments in the language itself,
attracting new users and retaining existing ones has proven challenging for Fortran.

In this talk, I will share the motivations behind the new Fortran-lang community and presents its
suite of projects. This includes the Fortran package manager, standard library, website, and other tools. 
Fortran-lang aims to provide a central place for Fortran users, beginners and experts alike, 
which fulfills an orthogonal role to the language standardization committee and compiler vendor communities.
Building upon the common best practices in programming and software development, we hope
we can help reduce the learning curve and increase adoption of Fortran in the future.
