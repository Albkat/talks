## Abstract

A thriving community is vital for the success and continuity of a programming language. Despite Fortranâ€™s role in science and engineering and the evolution of the language itself, attracting new users and retaining existing ones has been a challenge for Fortran. To address this, the open-source community Fortran-lang has formed in 2019. Here, we present the efforts of Fortran-lang including the Fortran package manager, standard library, website, and LFortran compiler. Fortran-lang aims to provide a central hub for Fortran users, complementing the language standardization and compiler communities. Building on the best practices in software development, we strive to simplify the language learning process and promote Fortran adoption.
