# fortran-lang talks

Repository to collaborate on fortran-lang talks and presentations.

## How to contribute

If you're working on a presentation about fortran-lang or any of its projects,
submit a PR that adds a subdirectory with the following format:

```
<event-name>-<topic>
```

and in that directory add a README.md that contains your name, title, and 
abstract.
Any other files in the directory will be your presentation assets--slides, web 
pages, videos, etc.
