__Session:__ Fortran-lang minisymposium (10 min)

__Abstract:__
A new community of developers has formed to unite Fortran users and modernize the Fortran ecosystem.
In this presentation, we describe the high-level features of Fortran that continue to make it a good choice for scientists and engineers in the 21st century and outline ongoing community efforts including the development of a Fortran standard library and package manager, the fostering of a friendly and welcoming online community, improved compiler support, and language feature development.
The lessons learned are common across contemporary programming languages and help reduce the learning curve and increase adoption of Fortran.
