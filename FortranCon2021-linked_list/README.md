__Abstract:__ 

The Fortran-lang stdlib was introduced to provide extensive support to fortran developers by providing modules that can be directly used in thier programs. A list is one of the necessary data structure that has numerous applications.
The project under Google Summer of Code programme aimed to implement an efficient linked list module that is devoid of any memory leak. The module covers a bunch of APIs that are important in initial phase.
The Linked list developed is Generic Heterogeneous list i.e. it supports storage of multiple data types in the same list. 
The APIs can be further explained in detail in presentation with suitable examples.
