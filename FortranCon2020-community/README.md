**Title**: Toward a thriving open source Fortran community

**Abstract**:
A thriving community around a programming language is essential for onboarding
newcomers to the language and retaining existing users.
Besides a few discussion boards and mailing lists, Fortran has not had a
healthy online community in the modern internet era, like many other
programming languages have.
Despite the developments of the language itself, its user base has been
declining as a result.
Many new software projects are now being started in languages like C++, Python,
or Julia, despite Fortran being better suited for the task at hand.
In this talk, we will discuss the need for and the ongoing development of the new
fortran-lang (https://fortran-lang.org) community and its suite of projects
that currently include a standard library, package manager, and a website.
Fortran-lang aims to provide a central place for Fortran users, beginning and
expert alike, to find a set of recommended tools, libraries, tutorials, and
discussion venues that are inclusive and welcoming of newcomers to the language.
We believe that an organized community and a home of Fortran on the internet,
in addition to the ongoing work by the Standards Committee and compiler developers,
are essential for the long-term thriving -- and not just mere survival -- of Fortran.
Finally, we will discuss the next steps, the one-year vision, and the 10-year
vision for going forward.
