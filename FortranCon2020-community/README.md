# FortranCon2020-community

**Title**: Toward a thriving open source Fortran community

**Abstract**:
A thriving community around a programming language is essential for onboarding
newcomers to the language and retaining existing users.
Besides a few discussion boards and mailing lists, Fortran has not had a 
healthy online community in the modern internet era, like many other 
programming languages have.
Despite the developments of the language itself, its user base has been 
declining as a result. 
Many new software projects are now being started in languages like C++, Python,
or Julia, despite Fortran being better suited for the task at hand.
In this talk, we'll discuss the need for and the ongoing development of the new
fortran-lang (https://fortran-lang.org) community and its suite of projects.
Fortran-lang aims to provide a central place for Fortran users, beginning and 
expert alike, to find a set of recommended tools, libraries, tutorials, and 
discussion venues.
We believe that an organized online community, besides the ongoing work by the
Standards Committee and compiler developers, is essential for the long-term 
thriving--and not just mere survival--of Fortran.
Finally, we'll discuss the next steps, the one-year vision, and the 10-year 
vision for going forward.
