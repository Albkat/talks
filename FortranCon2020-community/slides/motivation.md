### Problem and Motivation

* Fortran lacks modern tooling
* Poor ecosystem of libraries
* Fortran users are scattered and disconnected
* New user adoption is diminishing
* New Fortran projects are diminishing
</section>


<section>

### Fortran lacks modern tooling

* No comprehensive standard library
* No go-to build system
* No package management solution
* Open source compilers few and far between

=> Fortran is hard to work with
</section>


<section>

### Poor general purpose library ecosystem

* Fortran originated in the pre-internet era
* Before email, websites, or version control
* GitHub? Forget about it!
* Many wheels re-invented but not published

➡ Scarce open source library ecosystem
</section>


<section>

### Fortran users are scattered and disconnected

* Difficult to find other users
* Conferences and meetups few and far between
* Feeling alone is not fun
* It makes you re-invent the wheel
* It makes you want to give up
</section>


<section>

### Fortran also has a PR problem

* Most of society still only knows of FORTRAN
* Mainframes, punchcards, and UPPERCASE
* Images deeply engraved into the cultural DNA
* Fortran is not the village idiot of programming languages,
yet, it is being treated as such

➡ This is bad. We need to change it.

### Our goals for Fortran

* Fortran should be _easy_ to work with
* Fortran should be _fun_ to work with
* Working with Fortran should spark joy
* It should feel like play and not work
</section>


<section>

### How do we get there?

We need:

* A rich standard library
* An easy-to-use, fast package manager
* A cutting-edge open source compiler and interpreter 
* A modern, beautiful website and learning resources
* A welcoming and inclusive online community
