<!--
Fortran has been traditionally developed by compiler vendors, 
and later also by the standards committee.
It was a mainstream language when computing was a niche,
and became a niche language when computing turned mainstream.
It is the oldest high-level language still in use today,
and thus originates in the pre-internet era.

### Why do we need an online Fortran community?
</section>

<section>

### Developed by vendors and committees 

* Traditionally, Fortran has been developed by compiler
vendors and standards committees
* Vendors follow the buck (customers)
* Committees follow the vendors

=> Individual developers left behind
</section>

<section>

### A niche language

* Fortran was mainstream when computing was niche 
* Niche when computing turned mainstream

=> Difficult to find other developers and learning resources
</section>


<section>

#### Originated in the pre-internet era

* Before email, websites, or version control
* GitHub? Forget about it!

=> Scarce open source library ecosystem
</section>

<section>

#### Where we are now

* No connected and organized community of developers
* No small-to-medium sized projects started in Fortran
* Many applications + few libraries = little code reuse
* New software projects not started in Fortran
despite it being optimal for the task at hand
